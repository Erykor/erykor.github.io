Today I'm upset because I just found that my long-term barber upgraded my service without notifying me and charged me more money for a while. Such situations do happen in life, yet my way to deal with them is immature and unproductive.

When I first notified the unexpected price increase, I was confused and immediately angry and resentful such than I want to immediately stop using their service. Then I was overwhelmed with accusatory emotion, made a poor argument, and got a reply from my barger that he actually gave me discount for the upgraded service. The outcome? I left, with nothing resolved and being upset.

As I become calm with time going by, I realized I could deal with such situation in a more productive manner, which can help maintain a good relationship with my barber or help me move on with no hard feelings. Specifically, next time when I meet such a situation, I will follow these steps:

1. Cool Down: First, take a little time to cool down. I need to ignore my first two thoughts, which are driven by emotions. It's much harder to have a productive conversation when I'm feeling heated.
2. Confirm the Issue: Make sure that there wasn't a misunderstanding. It's pssible there may have been some miscommunication or a mistake. In this stage, I don't know the full picture of what happend and the important thing is to collect information. So it should be avoied to have emotion or to assume external things being wrong.
3. Prepare Points and Approach: Before I have a discussion with my barger, I need to clearly articulate my concerns. I want to ensure that I convey how I feel about the situation, why I'm upset, and what I'd like to happen next. It's important to explain my feelings in a calm, non-accusatory manner, such as using "I" statements to express how I feel.
4. Open Dialogue and Seek Solutions. Maintain an open, respectual dialogue, discuss potential solutions and see if there's a resolution that we're both comfortable with. Maybe I don't want the upgraded service, or perhaps I'd appreciate being consulted about price increases in the future, or my barger might offer a refund or discount on my next visit.
5. Decide What's Best for Me: Based on reaction, decide whether I want to continue using their services. If my barger is willing to address my concerns and take steps to ensure this situation doesn't happen again, I might decide to continue using their service. If not, it could be best to find a new barber.

Communication is key in such situations. It's not a good idea to end the situation with carrying any negative emotions or grudges, regardless of which solutions I choose.
