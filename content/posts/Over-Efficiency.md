Do we need to pursue 100% efficiency? I've been thinking the question for a while and my answer is, NO.

100% efficiency makes us feel the need to utilize every resource we have, even when it's not necessary, and this can indeed lead to wasted efforts, stress, reduced productivity, and suppressed creativity.

What's the reason behind the 100%-efficiency mindset?
- Fear of Waste: We're conditioned by education that to waste is bad. This is often involved with the fear of missing out.
- Perfectionism: 100% is a word that sounds good, linking with perfect, which also gives a feeling of control.

I don't know the proper level of efficiency yet, and I think it depends. But I don't want 100% efficiency to dominate me.
