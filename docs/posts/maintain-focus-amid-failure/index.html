  <section><p>I&rsquo;ve found that I feel demotivated to do a task with high chance of failure and I want to improve that. After chatting with GPT4, I&rsquo;ve got some nice advice.</p>
<p>The key is to reframe our perspectives: Instead of viewing the task as a likely failure, consider it as a learning opportunity. We&rsquo;ll gain knowledge, skills, and experiences that will be beneficial in our future endeavors, regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p>This concept is also known as cognitive reframing, and it’s a psychological strategy that can be used to manage stress, anxiety, and negative thinking patterns.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re faced with a challenge that we perceive has a high chance of failure, it’s natural to feel apprehensive or even demotived. But with cognitive reframing, we consciously choose to look at the situation from a different perspecive, one that s positive and growth-oriented.</p>
<p>Consider a task that has high chance of failure. Instead of dwelling on the potential negative outcome, focus on the potential benefits that could arise from attempting the task. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning Opportunity: Even if the task does not succeed as planned, we will gain valuable experiences and learn from our mistakes. This knowledge can be applied to future projects and could increase our chances of success in the long term.</li>
<li>Skill Development: Facing challenging tasks often requires developing new skills or honing existing ones. Whether it’s improving our problem-solving abilities, learning a new software, or enhancing our communication skills, these are valuable assets that can benefit us in many areas of life.</li>
<li>Resillence and Grit: Facing challenges head-on, expecially those with high risk of failure, builds resilience and grit - qualities that are highly valuable in in both personal and professional life. We’ll learn to bounce back from disappointments and keep pushing forward.</li>
<li>Innovation: Sometimes, when things don’t go according to plan, we&rsquo;re forced to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions. This can be a highly rewarding process and could even lead to a better outcome than we initially anticipated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that our perceptions can significantly influence our emotions and actions. By choosing to view a difficult task as an opportunity rather than an impending failure, we can help to mitigate negative emotions, incrase motivation, and improve our overall mindset.</p>
