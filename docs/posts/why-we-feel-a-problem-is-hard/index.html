  <section><p>When we perceive a problem as difficult, this hardness can be attributed to various factors. It&rsquo;s essential to demystify the concept and develop a more precise and shared understanding of it. Here are some factors that contribute to the difficulty of a problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hidden and implicit information: Critical information required for solving the problem may be missing, and you need to identify what that information is. This often requires adopting a different perspective from your normal view.</li>
<li>Unconventional perspective: You may need to see the problem from an unusual angle, rather than the perspective implied by its description. This can be challenging when it demands entirely new ways of thinking.</li>
<li>Confusing and distracting information: Extraneous information can hinder your ability to find a solution. Determining what is unimportant is as crucial as identifying what is important. An excess of information can overwhelm, distract, and cause a loss of focus.</li>
<li>Lack of specific knowledge: Without understanding the context, assumptions, or conceptual models related to the problem, finding a solution becomes difficult.</li>
<li>Lack of specific techniques: Previously difficult problems may have been solved through the development of innovative techniques by experts. It&rsquo;s often impossible to develop such techniques quickly.</li>
<li>Underlying problems: The problem at hand may only be a small aspect of a more significant underlying issue. Addressing the larger problem may be necessary to solve the initial one.</li>
<li>Unsolvability: Some problems cannot be solved without making sacrifices or compromises within the problem itself.</li>
<li>Attention management: A problem may present an exciting aspect that draws your attention, causing you to forget to examine other, more trivial, facets.</li>
<li>Mental trickery: The problem might use a mental trick to deceive you, leading you down an unproductive path.</li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding these factors, we can better assess and tackle the difficulties we encounter when attempting to solve complex problems.</p>
